Skeleton
-------------------------------

* Navigation Design - purely "global" (Garett. p 121)

Hierarchical, for every page the user should see the part of the tree he currently is on. 

* Wayfinding

A user should always see wayfinding cues for thr tree representing the hierarchy.

With clear titles for easy bookmarking.


* Contextual Navigation

Provided by links within texts (e.g. "see old travel reports for a new event to the same location).

* Cortesy navigation: NONE

These part are considered important and thus these nodes are via the top of the hierarchical navigation accessible.


* Index, site map: None, the size/scale allows for this ommission.


* Wireframe (see "wireframe.png")

For our project a single wireframe is sufficent to server our primary and secondary users' needs
