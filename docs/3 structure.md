Structure
-------------------------------

* Conceptual Model(s)

The entire website must rely on the (most common) conceptual model for a component and for the site as a whole to deliver a consistent experience.


We will take a conservative approach, e.g. we will not (yet) adopt models from the "mobile" world that switched over to the "desktop wold", but the site is planned in a way to allow for new models. 

* Error Messages (also see document "scope"). 

The user should not be able to provoke error messages (besides form field validation), i.e. prevention whereever possible.

However, in the case of an user caused error correction and recovery suggestions from the system must not break the consistency of the conceptual model(s).

Non user caused error should firstly indicate that it is a system error not caused by the user.


* Top-Down approach to content structuring (Garett, p. 89)

Organizational and navigational schemes by broadest categories split into subcategories.

Note: A requirement is that this information architecture can be easily changed and accomodate new offerings.

* Site structure: Hierarchical

The nature of our existing site reflects a hierarchical structure for information design. We will keep this because of familiarity with it and ease of use and orientation.

(See: Document "organizational scetch")

* Optional matrix structure for software functions:

If software functions have a "matrix structure", e.g. the event calendar with categories for filering or a search facility we will limit the "initial" categories to three. If necessary experienced users can access more categories "on demand"
