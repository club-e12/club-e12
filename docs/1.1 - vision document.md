Vision document for "club-e12.me"
-------------------------------

Remark: Conclusion at bottom.

Garett (p. 53), cit. "This document isn’t just a
list of objectives—it provides an analysis of the relationships among
the various objectives and of how those objectives fit into the larger
context of the organization"

* Relationships among objectives

Luckily our product objectives align very well with each other and the identifed user needs. 
However even in our case there are limitations.


* Conflicting objectives
There is a clear conflict of goals between our limited ressources and the user needs of persona "Sarah"
who would like to be able to accomplish all kinds of tasks with the club as soon as possible with the help of
her range of mobile devises.

However Persona Sarah is by no means an exceptional phenomenon nowadays! 
Across all generations plenty of peoply rely on mobile devices (especially phones) as the sole means of accessing
the internet!

(Remark: This is true in my place where a flat-rate for 4G/LTE fast connection is something about 25 USD/month,
and even a 10 USD/month plane come with 5 GB and 1000 min "voice" and 1000 texts).

* Conclusion

"Mobile" must be seen as "equal" from the very beginning.
