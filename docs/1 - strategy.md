Strategy for "club-12.me"
-------------------------------

Name of the site: club-e12.me

Description and current situation:

Club-E12 is a non-profit organization for the elderly in a remote and small rural town.
The club already has a site serving only static content, which is updated four times a year. 
At the Moment it is merely an incomplete mirror of the printed newsletter sent out every quarter to its members.

The club has a venue, where current information is provided via a notice board.

The signing up for trips and other events is via snail mail, notice board lists and/or phone.

# Strategy

## Organizational ("business") objectives.

Firstly the site is a reach out to as many club members as possible. Secondly it serves as a "business card" to a seondary audience, which is not actively targeted.

The club depends on "lean and efficent" processes run by volunteers, and the new site must not create organization work, this is especially true should any new functionality be added. The contrary would be very welcome, i.e. existing processes should be "streamlined"



## Product Objectives:

1. A new website shall be launched that is capable of (gradually) beeing a full substitute for the newsletter and the notice board for it's memebers.
The main purpose is to serve it's members but should also give a positive impression to external visitors. 
Therefore "brand identity" (Garett p. 39) also matters so far as it must not look so amateurish as the old one but rather give a professional impressione.

2. The burden of the static content editing (see "Persona" Janet below) must be spread over a team of editors. For these an easy to use web based solution (intranet part of the site) to edit html documents would be very welcome. 

4. Because of limited ressources the site shall be planned in a way to easily allow for further enhancements.

5. New functionallity beyond the static content known from the old web site are secondary, but high on the wish list (see document "1.1. vision" document) for details.



## User Needs based on segementation:

The result of our research and segementing our primary users is best described by "user models" aka. personas (Garret p.49)
(For our purposes we segment on age and technology-affinity but not on gender and income).

Primary audience (core audience)

Persona: Frank, 75 yrs. (rare user, outdated desktop PC, slow connetion)

He's actively involved in club live both as a consumer and a contributor. He actually has an aversion to technology which is reflected by his 
15 year old PC with a VGA-resolution monitor. He only uses it to exhange mails with his grandchildren. 
Because of his remote location he can only connect via landline and modem (no DSL).
From our research we know, that he would welcome the service to access up-to-date club information via the web besides his resistence to technology.

Persona: Sarah, 55 yrs. (technology savvy, prefers mobile access, newest laptop, multiple fast connections)

She is a M.D who retired early. She got to know our club from lectures on health topics she gave as an active M.D. She still gives these talks but 
also presentations from her long-distance travels to very exotic places.
She leads a very busy live style, even as a retiree, and is involved two special intererest groups of our club.
She would like to get as many things done with her iPad and iPhone, which almost completety replaced her laptop.
Time matters, and filling in a form on her iPhone is more convenient to her than using the phone (voice).
She almost get's nervous when she has no highspeed connection, no matter if wifi or mobile 4G (LTE)

Persona: Janet, 67 yrs. (user and sole content editor, notebook, fast connection)

A retired elementary school teacher who is very savvy with the internet and uses multiple devices.
She helped tranforming travel reports and summaries of lectures to html from other document formats produced by other memebers.
She's part of the group publishing the newsletter, maintaining the notice board and doing the paper work for events that need sign-up.


Secondary audience:

This audience is not described by "personas". It is simply about people,
* visiting our website because of hear say and are curious about us. 
* searched for a club like ours but did not know about us before.

In either or similar cases we would very much like to give a positive impression and deliver information they are typically interested in.
Perhaps we can get in touch with them on their first visit and/or increase the chances of repeated visits.
