To-do list for project club-e12
-------------------------------

 1. OK: setup git+project and a to-do list in it.
 2. OK read assignment requirements carefully again
 3. OK: read Garetts' ["The Elements of User Experience"](http://www.jjg.net/elements/)

 4. Plane 1 - Formulate Strategy
 5. Plane 2 - Scope & Structrue

Done / conclusions
------------------

Garett's 5 "Planes" are for real world projects, but his approach can also be used for a fictitious project, based on assumptions. If done (correctly) the small scale website of this project, with just a view pages implemented, should reflect that these fragments are part of a bigger picture, the strategy, and that finally the details of their implementation are based on sound considerations from throughout this process.

My personal expectation is that this process will give clues about "candidate pages" for implementation.
